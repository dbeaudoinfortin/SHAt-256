# SHAt-256
This project is a native Java implementation of the SHA-256 algorithm using a tree structure. It is intended for educational purposes and is not performant enough for practical applications. I originally built this in 2014 to gain a deeper understanding of how the SHA-2 algorithms work and the effects of each individual operation. In 2024 I decided to publish it on GitHub. Implementing it as a tree structure makes it easier to visualize the patterns of the operations and to learn the role of each one.

## How it works

(coming soon)

## Requirements

- Requires Java 8 or later.
- If you want to build the jar from the source code you will need [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
